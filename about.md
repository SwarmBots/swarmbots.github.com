- - -

> SwarmBots is a project for the Principles of Engineering class at Olin College of Engineering in Needham, MA. 

## Project Goal
> Create a platform of small robots capable of achieving complex tasks through teamwork with a budget of just $250.

## Minimum Deliverables
> At minimum we want to make two robots able to navigate a known toy-world in a coordinated manner. This includes but is not limited to:
* Location awareness
* Synchronized movement
* Communication between robots and master computer
* Socially connected web app to allow people all over the world to control the robots

## Learning Objectives
* Improve programming competency of our team members.
* Understand AI concepts such as path finding, speech detection, and swarm behavior.
* Understand electrical systems to achieve wireless communication, obstacle detection, location finding, etc.
* Learn how to connect robots to the internet and vice-versa.
