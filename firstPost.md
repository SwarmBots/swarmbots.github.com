##Staying on Schedule
>When we first started this project, we had set some pretty ambitious deadlines, not realizing just how long it would take to get parts ordered. In the meantime, we had said that we wanted to have our team website up and running before we got back from spring break, and here we go!
>It's been a long few days, but the site layout and templating is finally all done! This site is built using Jekyll and hosted on GitHub pages. Having this option for hosting our website is great for many reasons.

> - We can keep all of our code in one place, our [GitHub][].
