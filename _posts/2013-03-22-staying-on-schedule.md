##Staying on Schedule

> When we first started this project, we had set some pretty ambitious deadlines, not realizing just how long it would take to get parts ordered. In the meantime, we had said that we wanted to have our team website up and running before we got back from spring break, so here we go!  
>
> It's been a long few days, but the site layout and templating is finally all done. This site is built using Jekyll and hosted on GitHub pages. Having this option for hosting our website is great for many reasons:  
><br />
> * We have the option of either HTML or markdown for writing pages.
> * Team members are forced to learn to use git to push updates to the site.
> * We can keep all of our code in one place, our [GitHub][].  
>   
>So this seems like an all-around convenient platform for us to document our work on. Look for more updates in the near future.
