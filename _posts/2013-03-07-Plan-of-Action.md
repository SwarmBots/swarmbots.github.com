##Our Proposal

>We anticipate having two robotic vehicles that can navigate in a hard coded virtual world without running into each other.  
>These robots will have some degree of location awareness, move in sync, and communicate to each other. 
>They will all be controlled by a single laptop computer over serial radio.

>Brief overview of subsystems:
>The Mechanical Subsystem- Goal is to make robots that can be assembled in a matter of minutes and are robust.
>The Electrical Subsystem - Goal is to make our own arduinos from scratch that will interface with Nordic's nRF24L01 + 2.4GHz RF radios. 
>We plan on making our own obstacle detection sensors through phototransistors and LEDs.
>The Software Subsytem- Goal is to be able to take commands from the laptop and use the arduino + radio combination to move the robot around.
>The software portion is responsible for complex movement between the robots.

>Far Reaching Goal: Control our robots through a web app that's connected to facebook and twitter.  
>This could also involve some game design.
